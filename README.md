## Clouds

Welcome to the chapter on Cloud Computing! Cloud computing has revolutionized the way we store and access data and applications.
In this chapter, we will explore the fundamental concepts and benefits of cloud computing.

Cloud computing offers scalability, flexibility, and cost-efficiency by providing access to computing resources over the internet.
It eliminates the need for on-premises infrastructure and enables seamless deployment of software solutions.

Throughout this chapter, we will cover cloud service models, deployment models, and cloud security considerations.
We will also explore a popular cloud platform that's Azure.

By the end of this chapter, you will have a solid understanding of cloud computing principles and be ready to leverage
the cloud for your projects. Let's dive into the world of cloud computing and unlock its potential for scalable and
efficient software development.
